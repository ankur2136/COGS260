## Usage of callbacks

A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument `callbacks`) to the `.fit()` method of the `Sequential` model. The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each stage of the training.

```

### Callback

```python
keras.callbacks.Callback()
```

Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.

__Properties__

- __params__: dict. Training parameters
	(eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs...).
- __model__: instance of `keras.models.Model`.
	Reference of the model being trained.

The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
the current batch or epoch.

Currently, the `.fit()` method of the `Sequential` model class
will include the following quantities in the `logs` that
it passes to its callbacks:

- __on_epoch_end__: logs include `acc` and `loss`, and
	optionally include `val_loss`
	(if validation is enabled in `fit`), and `val_acc`
	(if validation and accuracy monitoring are enabled).
- __on_batch_begin__: logs include `size`,
	the number of samples in the current batch.
- __on_batch_end__: logs include `loss`, and optionally `acc`
	(if accuracy monitoring is enabled).

### BaseLogger

```python
keras.callbacks.BaseLogger()
```

Callback that accumulates epoch averages of
the metrics being monitored.

This callback is automatically applied to
every Keras model.

### ProgbarLogger

```python
keras.callbacks.ProgbarLogger()
```

Callback that prints metrics to stdout.

### History

```python
keras.callbacks.History()
```

Callback that records events
into a `History` object.

This callback is automatically applied to
every Keras model. The `History` object
gets returned by the `fit` method of models.

### ModelCheckpoint

```python
keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath, monitor='val_loss', verbose=0, save_best_only=False, mode='auto')
```

Save the model after every epoch.

`filepath` can contain named formatting options,
which will be filled the value of `epoch` and
keys in `logs` (passed in `on_epoch_end`).

For example: if `filepath` is `weights.{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.hdf5`,
then multiple files will be save with the epoch number and
the validation loss.

__Arguments__

- __filepath__: string, path to save the model file.
- __monitor__: quantity to monitor.
- __verbose__: verbosity mode, 0 or 1.
- __save_best_only__: if `save_best_only=True`,
	the latest best model according to
	the validation loss will not be overwritten.
- __mode__: one of {auto, min, max}.
	If `save_best_only=True`, the decision
	to overwrite the current save file is made
	based on either the maximization or the
	minization of the monitored. For `val_acc`,
	this should be `max`, for `val_loss` this should
	be `min`, etc. In `auto` mode, the direction is
	automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity.

### EarlyStopping

```python
keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=0, verbose=0, mode='auto')
```

Stop training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving.

__Arguments__

- __monitor__: quantity to be monitored.
- __patience__: number of epochs with no improvement
	after which training will be stopped.
- __verbose__: verbosity mode.
- __mode__: one of {auto, min, max}. In 'min' mode,
	training will stop when the quantity
	monitored has stopped decreasing; in 'max'
	mode it will stop when the quantity
	monitored has stopped increasing.

### RemoteMonitor

```python
keras.callbacks.RemoteMonitor(root='http://localhost:9000')
```

Callback used to stream events to a server.

Requires the `requests` library.

__Arguments__

- __root__: root url to which the events will be sent (at the end
	of every epoch). Events are sent to
	`root + '/publish/epoch/end/'`. Calls are HTTP POST,
	with a `data` argument which is a JSON-encoded dictionary
	of event data.

### LearningRateScheduler

```python
keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(schedule)
```

Learning rate scheduler.

__Arguments__

- __schedule__: a function that takes an epoch index as input
	(integer, indexed from 0) and returns a new
	learning rate as output (float).

### TensorBoard

```python
keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs', histogram_freq=0)
```

 Tensorboard basic visualizations.

This callback writes a log for TensorBoard, which allows
you to visualize dynamic graphs of your training and test
metrics, as well as activation histograms for the different
layers in your model.

TensorBoard is a visualization tool provided with TensorFlow.

If you have installed TensorFlow with pip, you should be able
to launch TensorBoard from the command line:
```
tensorboard --logdir=/full_path_to_your_logs
```
You can find more information about TensorBoard
- __[here](https__://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html).

__Arguments__

- __log_dir__: the path of the directory where to save the log
	files to be parsed by tensorboard
- __histogram_freq__: frequency (in epochs) at which to compute activation
	histograms for the layers of the model. If set to 0,
	histograms won't be computed.

# Create a callback

You can create a custom callback by extending the base class `keras.callbacks.Callback`. A callback has access to its associated model through the class property `self.model`.

Here's a simple example saving a list of losses over each batch during training:
```python
class LossHistory(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_train_begin(self, logs={}):
        self.losses = []

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs={}):
        self.losses.append(logs.get('loss'))
```

---

### Example: recording loss history

```python
class LossHistory(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_train_begin(self, logs={}):
        self.losses = []

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs={}):
        self.losses.append(logs.get('loss'))

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=784, init='uniform'))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop')

history = LossHistory()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=128, nb_epoch=20, verbose=0, callbacks=[history])

print history.losses
# outputs
'''
[0.66047596406559383, 0.3547245744908703, ..., 0.25953155204159617, 0.25901699725311789]
'''
```

---

### Example: model checkpoints

```python
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=784, init='uniform'))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop')

'''
saves the model weights after each epoch if the validation loss decreased
'''
checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath="/tmp/weights.hdf5", verbose=1, save_best_only=True)
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=128, nb_epoch=20, verbose=0, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test), callbacks=[checkpointer])

```
