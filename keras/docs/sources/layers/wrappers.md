### TimeDistributed

```python
keras.layers.wrappers.TimeDistributed(layer)
```

This wrapper allows to apply a layer to every
temporal slice of an input.

The input should be at least 3D,
and the dimension of index one will be considered to be
the temporal dimension.

Consider a batch of 32 samples, where each sample is a sequence of 10
vectors of 16 dimensions. The batch input shape of the layer is then `(32, 10, 16)`
(and the `input_shape`, not including the samples dimension, is `(10, 16)`).

You can then use `TimeDistributed` to apply a `Dense` layer to each of the 10 timesteps, independently:
```python
# as the first layer in a model
model = Sequential()
model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(8), input_shape=(10, 16)))
# now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 8)

# subsequent layers: no need for input_shape
model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(32)))
# now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 32)
```

The output will then have shape `(32, 10, 8)`.

Note this is strictly equivalent to using `layers.core.TimeDistributedDense`.
However what is different about `TimeDistributed`
is that it can be used with arbitrary layers, not just `Dense`,
for instance with a `Convolution2D` layer:

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(TimeDistributed(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3), input_shape=(10, 3, 299, 299)))
```
